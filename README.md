# EDS223 Homework 1: Environmental Justice in The Bronx, NY

This repository contains the response to Homework 1 in EDS223 - *Geospatial Analysis & Remote Sensing*, completed by Sofia Sarak.

This analysis aims to explore environmental justice issues using data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It focuses specifically on The Bronx, New York, comparing percentage of low income residents to PM2.5 concentration. The link used to access this data originally is no longer in operation, but more EPA data can be found [here](https://www.epa.gov/data). An [unofficial EJScreen tool](https://pedp-ejscreen.azurewebsites.net/) using the same data is still available.
